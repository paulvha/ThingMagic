Using tmr_tcp.c to communicate over TCP from ther Mercury API to a
remote connected  TMR reader


Install the software and connect the TMR reader to a remote Linux device.

To compile : cc -o tmr_tcp  tmr_tcp.c

Start the server program like:

	./tmr_tcp /dev/ttyUSB0

	/dev/ttyUSB0 = port where TMR reader is connected

	(-v option can be added to tserv to show the bytes exchanged)
  

See the Mercury programmer manual about using alternative transport layer

To enable tcp in the program BEFORE create (e.g. in demo.c)

	ret = TMR_setSerialTransport("tcp", &TMR_SR_SerialTransportTcpNativeInit);
  
	if (TMR_SUCCESS != ret)
	{
		errx(1, "adding the custom transport schemes %s\n", TMR_strerr(rp, ret));
	}

Open the program on the client with a device like

	./demo tcp://192.168.1.142:3333

	192.168.1.142 = TCP address of remote computer
	3333	      = port (as indicated in the tserv.c)
