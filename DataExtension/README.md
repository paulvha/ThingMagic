## Background

Based on a number of questions how to connect and use the data extensions from the universal Reader Assistent (URA)
from ThingMagic this document has been created. It contains explanation of the settings, data format in sample JAVA program
to receive, parse and display the content from HTTP POST.

## Usage

For more information read the URA-data_extensions.odt

To run the sample receiver for the POST content: nodejs ura.js


## Software installation and usage

Make sure that node.js is installed (enough information on internet around that)
Please be aware the node.js is called nodejs in Ubuntu because of potential conflict with other programs.
