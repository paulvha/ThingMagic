This directory contains a word document with step by step instructions for a proof of concept  to achieve
- Reading the EPC from an RFID with a ThingMagic reader,
- store these EPC with a timestamp in daily files
- Manually or automatically import and refresh the data from these files into Excel 2016

This requires :
- Visual Studio 
- ThingMagic SDK 1.29.4
- Excel 2016  / Office 365

Knowledge of Visual Studio, VBA and Macro programming is a pre, but with the step-by-step novice
users should be able to achieve the desired outcome

This is version 1.0. It works but has not been deeply tested yet, but it did work as expected. Feedback appreciated

Paul
